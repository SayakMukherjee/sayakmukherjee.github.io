Under the guidance of Bernd Dudzik and Tom Viering, he is exploring ways to build AI that doesn’t just process data but truly understands the rich, nuanced world of human emotions — enhancing intelligent interaction and decision-making. His research focuses on developing data-efficient, context-sensitive, and privacy-preserving multimodal AI systems for automatic affect prediction—paving the way for Artificial Empathic Agents. Current deep learning approaches struggle with data efficiency and in capturing situational, cultural, and personal contextual subtleties, limiting their real-world effectiveness. Sayak’s work bridges insights from cognitive psychology and (probabilistic) machine learning to model human cognitive-affective processes more effectively, thereby addressing these key challenges.\nBeyond affective computing, he is passionate about generative modelling and test-time adaptation of pre-trained models. Holding a Master’s in Computer Science, with one year of research experience at the Computer Vision Lab, TU Delft and three years of experience as an application developer at Oracle, Sayak brings a unique blend of industrial expertise and deep research curiosity to the future of human-centered AI.\n\n\n🎓 MSc Computer Science\nDelft University of Technology\n🎓 BTech Information Technology\nWest Bengal University of Technology"
