Sayak is a PhD student at the Human Oriented Machine Perception (HOMI) Lab at TU Delft. Under the guidance of [Bernd Dudzik](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/b.j.w.dudzik/?cHash=14faedd04b6a16627463d4d97027a904) and [Tom Viering](https://www.tomviering.nl/), he is exploring ways to build AI that doesn't just process data but truly understands the rich, nuanced world of human emotions â€” enhancing intelligent interaction and decision-making? His research focuses on developing data-efficient, context-sensitive, and privacy-preserving multimodal AI systems for automatic affect predictionâ€”paving the way for Artificial Empathic Agents. Current deep learning approaches struggle with data efficiency and in capturing situational, cultural, and personal contextual subtleties, limiting their real-world effectiveness. Sayakâ€™s work bridges insights from cognitive psychology and (probabilistic) machine learning to model human cognitive-affective processes more effectively, thereby addressing these key challenges. 

Beyond affective computing, he is passionate about generative modelling and test-time adaptation of pre-trained models. Holding a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, with one year of research experience at the Computer Vision Lab, TU Delft and three years of experience as an application developer at Oracle, Sayak brings a unique blend of industrial expertise and deep research curiosity to the future of human-centered AI.
